### Migrate old policies (GUI and Server)

If you already have policies created before MediaConch 16.09 release and want them back, follow this procedure.  
First, go to your local folder:  

On Windows: go to %APPDATA% (most of the time, it will be C:\Users\$USER\AppData\Roaming\).  

On Mac OS: go to your $HOME/Library/Application Support/ directory (most of the time, $HOME will be /Users/$USER).  

On Linux: go to your $HOME/.local/share/ directory (most of the time, $HOME will be /home/$USER).  

Then, go to MediaConch/policies (or MediaConch\policies on Windows) directory, create if not existing a directory named "-1" and move the XSL files to this directory.  

Launch the GUI or Server and policies will be loaded.  

Contact us if you created complex policies and would like us to move them to the new format
